# Remaining work

- [ ] Work out how to multiplex textures into a single draw call
- [ ] Clean up `ImmediateModeContext` constructor to be less onerous (or add a supporting service `IUserInterfaceManager`)
- [ ] Clean up shader usage, create material class
- [ ] Get different types of primitive geometry to render in the UI (lines, triangles, filled and stroked boxes, text, images).
- [ ] Start to build up some basic controls and control management (buttons, checkboxes, etc).
