# Surreal

A game engine built with modern .NET technologies.

## Features

The engine is built as a 'toolkit' of functionalities, as opposed to an over-arching framework.

This means you can compose and use whatever systems make sense for your project, and replace core components if they don't.

* Asset management with hot-reloading.
* Platform abstractions for common systems:
  * Audio rendering
  * Graphics rendering
  * Input management
* Actor system.
* Game boot-strapping.
